== Description ==
Greencon is plugin which turns your simple posts into high quality articles with best conversion. Plugin has more than 20 ready blocks to style, format and add special blocks to your site. In the same time, speed is our priority and plugin doesn't load anything on your pages except assets of blocks which you use on page.

== Seo schema ==
Greencon blocks have also Schema markup, so you can get better snippets in google. Available seo schema variants are: product schema, how to, event, video, ratings (in products), lists.

== Conditional asset loading ==
We believe that Greencon is fastest possible plugin for Gutenberg. It's because plugin uses unique conditional asset loading. All blocks are divided on style chunks which are loaded only when you use them on page. All dynamic libraries have no jquery dependencies. All styles are loaded inline with blocks to prevent CLS and incompatibilities with cache plugins. Reusable blocks and Template environment are supported.

== Take it a step further with GutenCon ==

Gutencon has few extra special helpers and options

- **Link parser**. Offerbox and listing blocks have option for link parsing. You add link to product page, for example, on Amazon and plugin parses image, title, description, price and place them into block. This is huge time saver.
- **Link hidder**. Select any text on site and add special link hidder. Users on your site will see regular link, but search spiders will see just text instead of link, so, you can save link juice
- **RH Link PRO**. This is bonus addon which can help to replace all your affiliate ids or part of links from all blocks on your site
- **RH Chart PRO**. This is bonus addon which can help you to build any kind of [charts, diagrams, comparison bars](https://remag.wpsoul.net/dynamic-charts-and-graphs-demo-page/) based on chart.js library.
